## Build & Learn

I love to learn by building projects and tinkering with stuff. I am interested and currently learning about Machine Learning and Low level programming using C and Rust. Also, I am a somewhat experienced full-stack web developer and have built and hosted large projects using my current favorite stack;

- React
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- GraphQL
- Python
- Planetscale/Deta
- Prisma
- Express
- Apollo Server/Client

I am on GitHub to share my projects and sometimes contribute to open source.

I like challenges but I am sometimes too shy to ask ðŸ˜…
I like working on fun and exciting projects.
