## Build & Learn

I love to learn by building projects and tinkering with stuff. I am interested and currently learning about Machine Learning and Low level programming using C, Zig and Rust. Also, I am an experience web developer -- I have built and hosted several full-stack web applications.

I am on GitHub to share my projects and sometimes contribute to open source.

I like challenges but I am sometimes too shy to ask ðŸ˜…
I like working on fun and exciting projects.
