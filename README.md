## I learn to build & build for funðŸ˜Š

I love to learn by building projects and tinkering with stuff. I am interested and currently teaching myself Machine Learning and systems programming, using C, Zig and Rust. I also have some experience building full-stack web applications using JavaScript/TypeScript, React, Node.js and Next.js. I mostly do scripting with python and also use it for machine learning and data-related projects.

I like working on fun, exciting and challenging projects.
