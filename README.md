## I learn to build & build for funðŸ˜Š

I love to learn by building projects and tinkering with stuff. I am interested and currently teaching myself Machine Learning and game Dev, programming using C/C++, Zig and Rust. Also, I am an experience web developer using TypeScript, Nodejs and React. I'm quite good at Python as well.


I like challenges but I am sometimes too shy to ask ðŸ˜… -- send some my way UwU.

I like working on fun and exciting projects.
